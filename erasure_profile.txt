#Creating an erasure-coded pool (referensi: Mastering ceph)

#To see a list of the erasure profiles, run the following command:
$ ceph osd erasure-code-profile ls

#Let's see what configuration options it contains using the following command:
$ ceph osd erasure-code-profile get default

#This is almost perfect for our test cluster; however, for the purpose of this exercise, we will
create a new profile using the following commands:
$ ceph osd erasure-code-profile set example_profile k=2 m=1 plugin=jerasure technique=reed_sol_van
$ ceph osd erasure-code-profile ls

#You can see our new example_profile has been created:
Now, let's create our erasure-coded pool with this profile:
# ceph osd pool create ecpool 128 128 erasure example_profile

#The preceding command gives the following output:
The preceding command instructs Ceph to create a new pool called ecpool with 128 PGs.
It should be an erasure-coded pool and should use the "example_profile"  we previously
created.
Let's create an object with a small text string inside it and then prove the data has been
stored by reading it back:
$ echo "I am test data for a test object" | rados --pool
ecpool put Test1 â€“
$ rados --pool ecpool get Test1 -

#First, find out what PG is holding the object we just created:
$ ceph osd map ecpool Test1

#We can now look at the folder structure of the OSDs and see how the object has been split
using the following commands:
$ ls -l /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-2/current/1.40s0_head/
# The preceding command gives the following output:
$ ls -l /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-1/current/1.40s1_head/
# The preceding command gives the following output:
$ ls -l /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-0/current/1.40s2_head/
